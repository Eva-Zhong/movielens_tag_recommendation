den vipper ml fille og fille-enhalv. jeg satte den et trin op efter den blev lidt i hovedet,823,-1.0,,
den var slet ikke sÃ¥ flot som hans forrige film. dramaet var ikke helt oppe at ringe men jeg mÃ¥ indrÃ¸mme de var lidt fangende,71027,0.0,,
den var meget langsom. men den havde nogle gode momenter og elementer i sig,3134,1.0,,
"den svinger lidt mellem super gode scener og mindre interessante passager, jf. vurdering",7043,0.0,,
den starter isÃ¦r godt ud,6978,0.0,,
den spiller ikke efter de faste strukturer hvilket ellers kunne vÃ¦re forventet. den puller heller ikke nogen lame tricks til alt for billige grin. er positivt overrasket over Segels pen,58998,0.0,,

den havde nogle rigtig flotte skud,80126,1.0,,
den har virkelig mange sjove ting kÃ¸rende for sig. vÃ¦sentlig stÃ¦rkere end den fÃ¸rste. synes den lÃ¥ner nogle ting fra moderne sitcom og er i almindelighed meget moderne i sit indhold sÃ¥som netdating. at wifi gÃ¥r i stykker mm,103335,0.0,,
"den fungerer meget som en samling af gode scener i sig selv, frem for ét sammensat narrativ",7043,0.0,,
den er virkelig vildt konstrueret.,40148,0.0,,
den er virkelig smuk,2732,0.0,,
den er bare opbygget og fortalt virkelig tight og spændende,40148,0.0,,
den del af filmen hvor han bare går rundt og er fattig og stort set laver ingenting går godt nok utrolig meget i tomgang og bliver meget kedelig. Hvis man skal opleve hans kedsomhed og stilleståenhed så er missionen mere end vellykket,72848,1.0,,
"den bruger ret mange forskellige filmiske knep løbende, som er ret interessante. så har den også den der superstylistiske ting kørende som på en måde minder lidt om refens film",40148,0.0,,
"den bliver lidt fantastisk til sidst, når hun faktisk endelig møder sin long lost love på en bus. men som helhed er filmen lidt for langsommelig og flad i det synes jeg. hovedpersonen brænder igennem og er meget smuk",78272,1.0,,

"Den var virkelig solid. den havde en eller anden fin rytme ved sig, en ro, som bare kørte derudaf i fantastisk balance. Karaktererne og miljøet var fantastisk",5339,1.0,,
Den var sgu ret fin. den er sÃ¥dan lidt fragmentarisk i det. en masse scener.,88051,-1.0,,
"Den stiller spørgsmålet hvorvidt der er noget dybere spirituelt gemt i øjnene end den blotte materie og 'data', men den tør ikke helt svare på spørgsmålet, hvorfor den ender på en meget åben og uopklaret måde.",112804,0.0,,
Den startede virkelig godt. han er genial med hans magtundergravende tørre humor. men da historien begyndte at fylde for meget i anden halvdel af filmen gik det sjove desværre ud af filmen,67997,1.0,,
"Den har et lidt sjovt sammenfald mellem på en måde at være den store fortælling om kærligheden og på en anden måde at være tilfærdigt, tumlende hen ad vejen-historie, hvor de ikke engang ender op sammen i slutnignen",1230,1.0,,
Den fungerer lidt som en kolage som deles ind a tekststykker mellem scenerne - selvom der er et samlende narrativ gennem alle scenerne. den har virkelig mange fine passager. den var tangerende firre en halve på visse tidspunkter,6993,1.0,,
"Den er meget framentarisk, viser scener på en måde som nok hænger sammen i en historie, men alligevel er meget singulære. det minder mig lidt om godard",65259,1.0,,
